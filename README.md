# Bike-Sales-Anlysis
The analysis was done on a bike Sales data I collected from Kaggle and used Excel to Analyzed it, using Pivot table I created the visuals then use slicers to highlight gender performance, sales per region, marital status, commute distance, occupation per customers.
The analysis was about bike sales, I wanted to analyze the following...
1. Gender performance of the customers
2. The best purchasing region
3. The age bracket of highest buyers(In this I used the if 
function to group the age differences 
[=IF(L980>55, "Old", IF(L980>=31,"Middle Age",IF(L980<31,"Adolescent","Invalid")))])
4. The commute distance of buyers
5. the educational qualification.

From my analysis I noticed the age bracket that buys bike more 
are the "Middle Age" and the "Male" gender purchases more bike.
